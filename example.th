( in Thorn we have for now only basic types, such as )
( INT, FLOAT, BOOL and STRING )

(string is text surrounded by double-brackets) 
(notice than there is no spaces on begining and the end of comment)

[Hello, world!] put (btw, this is "Hello, world!" in Thorn. 'put' ... puts string into output)

( String can contain everything, even another pair of double-brackets )

[ this string contains [ nested string ] ] put
